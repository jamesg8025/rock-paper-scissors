# rock-paper-scissors
This Rock, Paper, Scissors game is a project to showcase some recently-learned skills from The Odin Project.

Initially being a console-only game, I later created a UI by using DOM manipulation and Events functions to make
the game dynamic. CSS was also added to make the game look much nicer.
